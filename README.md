These two lines in main.js need to be changed according to the server running:
const serverUrl = "https://c6xxzyeqi59i.usemoralis.com:2053/server";
const appId = "4k4UZvHipDvawqoOo0HqPUR6cnnMafK3pVzCDPhq";

## Run index.html
Make sure you install MetaMask extension on Chrome
Start by creating a local server: python -m http.server
Open index.html with local server

You should be able to see two buttons on index.html.
Pressing the first button logs you in to the MetaMask account.
Logout logs you out of it.
You may go to console to try the method created in main.js
For example: type down getTrades() to get trades of an NFT item
